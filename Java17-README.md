# Java 17 Features â€“ Explained with Examples

Java 17 is another Long-Term Support (LTS) release and brings several new language features, enhancements, and finalized preview APIs. Here's a curated list of key features with code examples.

---

## âœ… 1. Sealed Classes
**Purpose**: Restrict which classes can extend or implement a superclass.

```java
public sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Square {}
final class Circle implements Shape {}
final class Square implements Shape {}
```

---

## âœ… 2. Pattern Matching for `instanceof`
**Purpose**: Eliminate casting boilerplate after type checks.

```java
Object obj = "Java";
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

---

## âœ… 3. Switch Expressions (Standardized)
**Purpose**: Use switch as an expression, return values, and avoid fall-through.

```java
String day = "MONDAY";
int num = switch (day) {
    case "MONDAY", "TUESDAY" -> 1;
    case "WEDNESDAY" -> 2;
    default -> 0;
};
System.out.println(num);
```

---

## âœ… 4. `record` Classes (Introduced in Java 14, Stable Now)
**Purpose**: Concise syntax for immutable data classes.

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}

Person p = new Person("Alice", 30);
System.out.println(p.name() + " is " + p.age());
```

---

## âœ… 5. Text Blocks (Standardized)
**Purpose**: Handle multi-line strings more naturally.

```java
String json = """
    {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30
    }
    """;
System.out.println(json);
```

---

## âœ… 6. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generator API (JEP 356)
**Purpose**: Unified and extensible PRNG interface.

```java
RandomGenerator generator = RandomGeneratorFactory.of("L64X256MixRandom").create();
System.out.println(generator.nextInt());
```

---

## âœ… 7. JEP Highlights
- JEP 409: Sealed Classes
- JEP 406: Pattern Matching for `instanceof`
- JEP 382: New macOS Rendering Pipeline (for Apple Silicon)
- JEP 391: macOS/AArch64 Port

---

## âœ… 8. Deprecations & Removals
- RMI Activation removed
- Applet API deprecated (fully removed in Java 21)

---

## ðŸ’¡ Summary
Java 17 cements several modern features into the Java language and JVM, making code cleaner, safer, and more expressive. As an LTS release, itâ€™s highly recommended for production use going forward from Java 11.
